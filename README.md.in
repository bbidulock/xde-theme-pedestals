[@PACKAGE@ -- read me first file.  @DATE@]: #

@PACKAGE@
===============

Package `@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@` was released under CCPL:cc-by-nc-nd-3.0
license @DATE@.

This is a theme and a set of backgrounds for the _XDE (X Desktop
Environment)_ that provides a set of backgrounds on
a Telephone Pedestals and T1 Repeater theme.
This theme uses the Squared-green style from the [`xde-styles`][11]
package.

The source for `@PACKAGE@` is hosted on [GitHub][1].


Release
-------

This is the `@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@` package, released @DATE@.
This release, and the latest version, can be obtained from [GitHub][1],
using a command such as:

    $> git clone https://github.com/bbidulock/@PACKAGE@.git

Please see the [RELEASE][3] and [NEWS][4] files for release notes and
history of user visible changes for the current version, and the
[ChangeLog][5] file for a more detailed history of implementation
changes.  The [TODO][6] file lists features not yet implemented and
other outstanding items.

Please see the [INSTALL][8] file for installation instructions.

When working from `git(1)`, please use this file.  An abbreviated
installation procedure that works for most applications appears below.

This release is published under CCPL:cc-by-nc-nd-3.0 (primarily because
the base styles used to develop these styles were licensed under this
license).
Please see the license in the file [COPYING][10].


Quick Start
-----------

The quickest and easiest way to get `@PACKAGE@` up and
running is to run the following commands:

    $> git clone https://github.com/bbidulock/@PACKAGE@.git
    $> cd @PACKAGE@
    $> ./autogen.sh
    $> ./configure
    $> make
    $> make DESTDIR="$pkgdir" install

This will configure, compile and install `@PACKAGE@` the
quickest.  For those who like to spend the extra 15 seconds reading
`./configure --help`, some compile time options can be turned on and off
before the build.

For general information on GNU's `./configure`, see the file
[INSTALL][8].


Prerequisites
-------------

This package needs the [`xde-styles`][11] package to be useful and also
requires the `xde-setbg(1)` program from the [`xde-ctools`][12] package.
